# CS50T Programming practice

Project in Scratch for [CS50T](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-understanding-technology-0) assignment.

## Assignment
- Your project must have at least two sprites, at least one of which must resemble something other than a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one condition, one loop, and one variable.
- Your project must use at least one sound.
- Your project must use standard Scratch blocks only to satisfy the above requirements (no add-ons).
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive, were quite short) but it can be less complex than Oscartime. As such, your project should probably use a few dozen puzzle pieces overall.

## Project
I decided to implement flappy bird using scratch built-in assets.
