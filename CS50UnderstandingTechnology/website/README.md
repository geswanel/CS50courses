# CS50T HTML CSS practice

Simple website build with HTML and CSS as assignment for [CS50T](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-understanding-technology-0) course.


## Assignment

- Your website's main page should live in index.html, since most web servers serve up index.html by default
- At least one other page, and your website's main page must somehow link to that page.
- Your website must include at least one image.
- Your website must be stylized with at least several CSS properties, which must live in styles.css (an "external stylesheet"), just as we saw (briefly) in css4.html. Your CSS needs to ultimately end up connected to your HTML, as well.
- Your website should be more complex than those from class (but much less complex than Harvard's home page!). As such, your website should probably use a few dozen HTML tags overall, plus several CSS properties.

## Design
